## Project Description

In this project i make a classification model for predicting if a user can be granted a loan or not. 

## Dataset

There are 491 training-data and 123 testing-data in this dataset. And in the training dataset there are 12 independent columns and 1 dependent column. This dataset attributes like Loan ID, if the loan applicant is married or not, the level of education, applicantâ€™s income etc. 

## Model

In this project i try 3 different type of models Random Forest, XGBoostm, and Linear Regression. And after evaluating all the models i choose Linear Regression because it produces the best f1 score among all of the models.
